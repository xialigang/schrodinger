# Numerical solution to Schrodinger equation
  The script `runge_kutta_2d.py` was written using python. I think it is very easy to understand it. Basically we are using Runge-Kutta algorithm.

# Results
  We performed two tests. One is for the quantum tunneling effect and the other is the Young's double-slit experiment. Both are very interesting!
  `tunneling` and `double-slit`

# Welcome to use it and give it a STAR!
